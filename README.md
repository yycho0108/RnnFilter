# RNN Filter

Experimental Repository for utilizing RNNs as filters.

The basic intuition is that given an observation of the trajectory over time,
RNNs would be able to discover the implicit uncertainty of the measurement - 
and potentially also the constraint that the underlying dynamic model obeys
(such as the non-holonomic constraint) in order to infer a more accurate recovery
of the actual trajectory.
